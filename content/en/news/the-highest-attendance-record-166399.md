Nigeria has the world's largest church led by Pastor Enoch Adeboye. Many churches around the world, including that church and our country's Grace and Truth Church, are multi-site churches. In other words, it is a branch church system where one church gathers in multiple locations. Our church is also a multi-site church that transcends regions and borders.

However, a total of 166,399 people attended Seoul and All Beloved Churches this week. The largest number of people attended was broken. Lord! Please give us never-ending revival so that more souls can be saved!
